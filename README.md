## Relationship Converter
```relationship_converter.py``` is a script which can convert all relationships of a given type between two item types in Jama into another relationship type using the Jama REST API. Users can configure the project to convert multiple relationships types at a one time if needbe (see script comments). 

Please note that this script is distrubuted as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.  This example omits error checking. Jama Support will not assist with the use or modification of the script.

1. As always, set up a test environment and project to test the script.

2. Fill out the CONFIG section of the script.  The necessary fields are:
  - ```username```
  - ```password```
  - ```base_url```
3. Create an object and set it's key-value pairs as follows (see script for more examples): 

    ```
    object = {}
    
    object.__setitem__("from_item_type_id", "89025")
    
    object.__setitem__("to_item_type_id", "89008") 
    
    object.__setitem__("old_relationship_type", "Related to")
